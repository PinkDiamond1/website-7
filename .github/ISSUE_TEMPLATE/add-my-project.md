Thanks for using ethers and we look forward to including a link to your project on ethers.

Please include the following details:

- Link to GitHub repository (currently only GitHub is supported, and the project must be public)
- A 256x256 px image (JPG or PNG) for a logo to include (attach it to this issue or include a link)
- A public e-mail address or Twitter account with DMs enabled (this is used to resolve dead links or other concerns with the project)

Notes:
- All projects are previewed and vetted before inclusion, and monitored for changes and regularly reviewed
- Project license should be compatible with Open Source Initiatives
- Images will be hosted by ethers to protect privacy; contact me to update a logo
